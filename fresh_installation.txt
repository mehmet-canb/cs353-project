# Install rye
# I chose to let rye handle the python version (dont use OS one etc)
make install-rye
# Close vscode and reopen to restart shell properly.

# Afterwards, download project dependencies.
rye sync

# Now, pre-commit is installed. Rye manages that dependency so lets `rye run` to set-up precommit
rye run pre-commit install

# Dependencies are now done. We need to initialize the database now.
make db-init

# After db-init finishes, you should be able to see your container running by typing `docker ps`
# If the list is empty, re-run `docker compose up db` without the -d flag
# (-detached -> console input and OUTPUT is hidden from us, lets see our errors!)

# Please fix your errors.
